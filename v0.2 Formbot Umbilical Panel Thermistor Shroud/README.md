# v0.2r1 Formbot Umbilical Panel Thermistor Shroud (and 4-way JST fan bus box)

## Description

The Formbot Umbilical cover has a large cut-out for the Umbilical chamber thermistor which makes it harder to maintain chamber heat. 
This little shroud helps prevent heated chamber air from escaping.  I haven’t edge sealed the Umbilical panel as yet, which will probably help as well.

Currently with a 60W bed heater and hot end @ 245c, the Umbilical chamber thermistor gets up to 50c. 
Being recessed, it’s also reasonably slow to respond and likely reads low given its attached to the PCB and has a compartment fan blasting it from below.

This folder also has a little printed box for a 4-way connector bus I use to insulate JST sockets soldered to a thin strip of prototyping circurt board.
