# v0.2 Dragon Burner Orbitor 2.0 Umbilical Toolhead Mount

## Description

Remixed of the VoronDesign v0.2r1 umbilical toolhead mount for Orbiter 2.0 and Dragon Burner hotend. The mount is offset slightly from stock and screws to standoffs on Orbiter motor mount.
Umbilical board and cable tie points relocated to suit offset layout and v0.2r1 x-carriage and Orbiter mounts.

Umbilical board mounts using m3 self tapper on one side and through hole m3 to threaded standoff on other side.
