# v0.2 Aliexpress Clone Wago 221-412 Kirigami Mount

## Description

Remixed / modified Kirigami wago mount from [Christoph Mueller](https://github.com/christophmuellerorg/voron_0_kirigami_bed) for cheap & cheerful Wago 221-412 2-way clones available from Aliexpress.
These ones don't have the side nubs to secure them when clipped in so needed to add nubs on the front left to retain them.  They are also a little wider than genuine wagos so have widened each bay but are still a tight fit to prevent them from popping out when the lever is opened.  Adjust as needed.

Mounts to Kirigami bed facing down to allow connectors to be opened and bed removed.
