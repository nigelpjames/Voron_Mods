# v0.2 Stealth Skirts Rear Panel Keystones

## Description

Remixed and modified rear Stealth Skirts panel for v0.2 with dual keystone ports for RJ45 joiners for RPi Ethernet and Input Shaper ports.

Note: This symetric orientation didnt allow enought room on the right to clear the Z Stepper for RJ45 keystone joiner and plug.  
Designed revised and both keystones relocated to the left side.
