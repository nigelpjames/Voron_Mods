# v0.2r1 Formbot Deck Chain Gap Cover

## Description

Simple pressfit cap with Voron logo to plug the gap in the cable chain for the v0.2r1 deck to help keep the chamber toasty :-)
After looking at the close up photo I might update it and extend it around the 1515 to the z-drive cover as I hadnt noticed the gap in front.
