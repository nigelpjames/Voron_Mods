# Universal Servo Horn for ERCF v2 Community MMU.

## Description

This is a new and improved, universal ERCF v2 Community Edition servo horn for Savox, GDW, and SG90 servos commingly used on this mmu.
Unlike the existing horn, this is printed on its side with layers running in the same direction as the ERCF tophats to reduce friction when its engaged.
Print as oriented, install 10mm BHSC and semi-captive nut before installing on the servo. Use a fine file or sandpaper to very lightly smooth and knock off any high layers / points on the sole of the horn where it engages with the hothat.

I find it easier to position and install it by first setting the ERCF servo to the move position (MMU_SERVO pos=move), attaching and positioning the horn on the servo spline so you can move the carriage without catching or rubbing on the top hats.
Install the servo screw to seat the horn firmly before tightening the m3 SHCS to imprint and clamp the horn to the servo splines.
