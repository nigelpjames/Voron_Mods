# v0.2 ADXL Nozzle Mount

## Description

I'm not a fan of the default v0.2r1 ADXL mount that attaches to the back of the x-carriage.  It's really fiddly and difficult to fit and interferes with homing if still attached and thought I would whip up a direct, attach nozzle mount.
Close and securely attached to the nozzle is best and is pretty easy to make assuming you have some fibre glass prototyping board and a Dremel or small hacksaw to cut and shape it and some drills.  
The fibre glass is more rigid and will wear much better than a full printed part.
