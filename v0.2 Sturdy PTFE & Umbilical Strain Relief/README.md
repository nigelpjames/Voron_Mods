# v0.2r1 Sturdy PTFE & Umbilical Strain Relief

 ## Description 

Remix and more sturdy version of the VoronDesign v0.2r1 Umbilical PTFE strain relief with addition riser and cable tie to secure the umbilical cable to minimise motion load and strain on the connector and pins.
Beefed part up with extended footprint to handle extra load and movement from the umbilical cable.  Clips and held in place by the Umbilical socket.
