# v0.2r1 Sturdy PTFE & Umbilical Strain Relief

 ## Description 

Remix and more sturdy version of the VoronDesign v0.2 Umbilical PTFE strain relief with Voron logo and additional riser and zip tie to secure the Umbilical cable to minimise motion load and strain on its connector and pins.
Beefed part up with extended footprint to handle extra load and movement generated by tethered umbilical cable.  Clips in and is held in place by the Umbilical socket.
